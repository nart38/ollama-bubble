I will try to keep scope of this app relatively narrow. I'm not planning to make
this app extremely feature rich AI tui. I want it to be a simple app that suits
my use case. But if you encounter a bug, have a nice idea or simply want to show me
a better way to get things done, please feel free to open an issue.
